# Monte Carlo Stock Simulator
This is a stock simulator based on the Monte Carlo simulation. What is the Monte Carlo simulation you ask? It is a probability model based off of random sampling to obtain numerical results. Many variables are run through a model which will then output all of the possible outcomes that a decision could lead to. Using this simulation, decision makers are able to see all of the outcomes and their likelyhood of occurence. The model gets its name from the casinos of Monte Carlo, which is very fitting to this model as both use randomness to develop an outcome. In the example I have coded, the simulator analyzes stock opening and closing prices from a user-given time frame which it then uses to show all of the possible outcomes with their likelyhood. You can search for any stock on the NYSE and any date beggining from 1930.
